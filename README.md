# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Jonathan, I am a passionate software engineer graduated from Makers Academy, a highly selective 16 weeks coding bootcamp. 

From a very young age, Iâ€™ve been passionate about video-games and applications. When I asked myself the teenagerâ€™s most important question, what do I want to become? The answer came to me as obvious - a software developer! Iâ€™m looking for a role where I can use my problem solving skills and passion for web design and for technology to build software, for my own self development as a software dev. 
I have a creative mind and I like reinventing the world through innovation, with a strong will for improvement, not only for myself, but for everything I touch. 

This is my Codewarrior Profile Badge, current status:

## Education
 
#### Maker's Academy (October 2019 - February 2020) 
At Makers, I have studied computer science and metaprogramming principles along with hands-on coding, working on web and desktop applications using Ruby and Javascript.
As a student I had the following responsibilities:
* To take ownership of my learning process, time-boxing tasks to increase my learning curve.
* To use Agile methodologies to work effectively in a team, using pair programming, XP values, daily standups and sprint planning.
* To give and receive feedback using code reviews and open/respectful communication.
* To understand project requirements, create user stories, define MVP's features, break features in smaller tasks to easily accomplish them.
* To collaborate with the other team members using GitHub as version control tools and using CI/CD to reduce integration risk.
* To code following principles like TDD and S.O.L.I.D of OOP design pattern to create clear, simple code and well-tested applications.
* To complete weekend projects based on approaching a problem.

## Personal Skills

At makers, we had weekend projects and it was mostly based on approaching a problem. The solution was to break it down into smaller parts, analyse its key factors, make the appropriate research, then build a solution and validate it via a test.

Within 2 weeks, our team decided to build a video-game as our final project. It allowed us to challenge ourselves and to utilise the programming skills we've learnt in the coding bootcamp, whilst also exposing us to the game engine Unreal, a leading creation tool used by gaming companies across the globe. Despite not having any experience on the engine, I personally had this ambition to know the maximum that I could, due to my passion about video-games but also, to deliver a product with an excellent user experience. We took a very methodical approach to building the software. Using test-driven development, we were able to visualise the features we wanted to create, create an environment to run our test, set up the variables needed, expect an outcome, and then work towards passing that test in the simplest way possible. I learned and applied new concepts quickly and effectively. 
I believe that to be a good Software developer, you must be organised, by planning a project before jumping to the code. TDD all behaviours and to maintain a high code quality so it can be released with a high performance, estimated requirements and without unexpected bugs. Weâ€™ve organised ourselves by doing daily standups, retros and delivering tasks, working in Pairs. 

During my time on working in Hospitality, teamwork was and is an essential part of it. Everytime I join a new team/restaurant, I listen actively to the other team's members' expectations, restaurant policies and what they need to accomplish so I can effectively contribute to the front-of-house team's objectives. I always value empathy and open friendly communication.

## Hobbies

* Board games - Chess & Cluedo
* Sports - Football, Baseball and Basketball
* Strong passion for Video-Games - Guild wars 2, Final Fantasy and Pokemon
* Cooking - Portuguese and South American recipes
